- Angular CLI
- Nest.js CLI
- MySQL

### Installation
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/just-another-finance-app.git
2. **Install NPM packages for the backend:**
    ```
    cd just-another-finance-app/backend
    npm install
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli (only if you need to add more modules)
    ```
    For more details, see [nest.js docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)
3. **Install NPM packages for the frontend:**
    ```
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    npm install -g @angular/cli (only if you need to add more modules)
    ```
    For more details, see [angular docs](https://angular.io/quick-start)
4. **Install MySQL**
    [Download & install MySQL Community](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and then run:
    ```
    mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
    ```
    ```
    CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';

    ```
    *NOTE:* **Replace** new_user, your_password, and your_database_name with **your own values**.

    * Project Settings: Make sure you update the database connection settings in your project (such as the Nest.js configuration file) with the correct details (database name, user, password).
    * Installation on Different Operating Systems: The installation process may vary slightly depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac or Linux.
    * Security: Be sure to follow security best practices, such as using strong passwords and limiting database user privileges.
